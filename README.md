## Latest Update
Okay so I kinda get the structure and way to translate the game
- Menus / Popup : Decrypted Eboot.bin
- Texture Menu Text:  FATPACKMH -> HUD's .fac archieve
- Items / Dialogs Text: FatPack -> Tables -> Table.fac

Somehow menu translation works, I'm focusing on bin files for now (somehow some menu text are images...crazy for me)
